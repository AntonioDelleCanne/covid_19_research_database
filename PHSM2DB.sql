-- TODO maybe include SOURCE *.sql


-- The dependencies informaitons are obtained from the phsm documents provided with the dataset
-- Table dependencies:
-- lineID uniquely identifies each row
-- (who_id, measure_number) uniquely identifies each row
-- iso <-> iso31661Numeric <-> countryTerritoryArea
-- iso -> who_region
-- who_code -> who_category, who_subcategory, who_measure


-- 1NF

-- * Since we are using the distinct comand to eliminate identycal rows (without including the line id),
-- the line ids are recreated.
-- (by observing the dataset is emerged that the who_id indicates the announcment (an act/law) of multiple measures.)
-- (by observing the data is is emerged that each who_id can contain different measure, so each measure will be identified)
-- * textual date representation is converted to sql date data type
-- * all the empty strings '' are replaced with NULL
-- * as in the documentation, when area_covered is NULL, it means that the measure is applied to the country / territory
-- * when enforcement is null we consider it to be 'Not known' and we replace it as such
-- * all the measures with measure_satge as 'introduction / extension of measures' seem to be standalone measures
-- that represent singel events, and have no duration in time, they all have date_end at null and
-- prev_measure_number and following_measure_number at null therefore these measure_stages will be changed to 'new'
-- * TODO since in the targeted field both textual and numerical information appears, we replace the numerical codes with
-- the corresponding meaning of each found in the documentaiton
-- * TODO put links in separate comun, where like https:// till space

-- cleaning step
-- in Pakistan records, both PAK and IND iso appear, since IND only happens two times,
-- we assume this is an error and we correct it by updating
-- the related fields: who_region, iso, iso_3166_1_numeric
-- select distinct country_territory_area, who_region, iso, iso_3166_1_numeric from phsm_record_1NF where country_territory_area = "Pakistan";
update phsm_record_1NF
set who_region='EMRO', iso='PAK', iso_3166_1_numeric=586
where country_territory_area='Pakistan';

-- after cleaning the data we tried to find a combination of attributes that could serve as primary key
-- by trial and error, we identified this combination to be:
-- who_code, who_id, targeted, comments
-- this can be verified by running the following (commented) query
-- however we can see that the comments attribute is in it, and it can't be removed from
-- the combination because there are rows that are ientical and the only difference is the comment
-- since the comment can't be part of the primary key because it doesn't have intrinsic meaning
-- and therefore cannot logically identify something, plus is is a text field with very variable length,
-- therefore making it unpractical for this use,
-- we keep using the artificial primary key 'measure_number' generated during the 1NF normalization

-- 2NF
-- A relation schema R is in 2NF if every nonprime attribute A in R is
-- fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R.
--
-- the schema here is the same as the one in 1NF since all the attributes in the table fully depend on the primary key

-- 3NF
-- A relation schema R is in 3NF if it satisfies 2NF and 
-- no nonprime attribute of R is transitively dependent on the primary key
--
-- * By observing the table dependencies, we see that who_code -> who_category, who_subcategory, who_measure , aso these are put in a separate table
-- the same is done for iso <-> iso31661Numeric <-> countryTerritoryArea ; iso -> who_region
-- * Also previous and following measure number are references respectively to previous and following phsm disposition's who_id so this is modeled
-- through the use of foreign keys
-- * Sudan,Israel,Pakistan have different who_regions (2), to accomodate this this we are creating the table phsm_iso_region
-- * Also the iso with value 'ISR', is associated with two different  iso_3166_1_numeric values, to accomodate this this we are creating the table phms_iso_iso_3166_1_numeric
