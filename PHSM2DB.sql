-- TODO maybe include SOURCE *.sql


-- The dependencies informaitons are obtained from the phsm documents provided with the dataset
-- Table dependencies:
-- lineID uniquely identifies each row
-- (who_id, measure_number) uniquely identifies each row
-- iso <-> iso31661Numeric <-> countryTerritoryArea
-- iso -> who_region
-- who_code -> who_category, who_subcategory, who_measure


-- 1NF
-- eliminate lineID and use of distinct to eliminate duplicated records
-- line ids are reassigned since in the original dataset some rows are duplicates
-- solve incongruences in the data, for instance 
-- Sudan,Israel,Pakistan have different who_regions (2) in different records, so one region will be chosen
-- by observing the dataset is emerged that the who_id indicates the announcment (an act/law) of multiple measures.
-- by observing the data is is emerged that each who_id can contain different measure, so each measure will be identified
-- by the who_id and by a progressive id within the who_id (measure_number)
-- text is converted to date
-- since in the dataset there aren't any null values in date_start and date_ed fields, we assume that meaures are inserted
-- in the database after they made their course and are no longer active

-- TODO unify/see what's up with who_ids

-- 2NF
-- A relation schema R is in 2NF if every nonprime attribute A in R is
-- fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R.
--
-- the schema here is the same as the one in 1NF since all the attributes in the table fully depend on the primary key

-- 3NF
-- A relation schema R is in 3NF if it satisfies 2NF and 
-- no nonprime attribute of R is transitively dependent on the primary key
--
-- by observing the table dependencies, we see that who_code -> who_category, who_subcategory, who_measure , aso these are put in a separate table
-- the same is done for iso <-> iso31661Numeric <-> countryTerritoryArea ; iso -> who_region
-- also previous and following measure number are references respectively to previous and following phsm disposition's who_id so this is modeled
-- through the use of foreign keys
